 THE THING FOR WHICH I WAS EXCITED TO DO IN THE APK MONTH IS ALREADY HAPPENING. :))  :))

 DURING MY COLLEGE LIFE I WANT TO BE A PART OF THE GEEKHAVEN, IIIC, GENETICX AND VIRTUOSI.
 BUT UNFORTUNATELY TILL NOW I M NOT A MEMBER OF ANY OF THESE BUT I WILL NEVER QUIT AND WILL TRY AGAIN...

 THE COURSES I HATE THE MOST IS LAL :((  AND I ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT WHAT THIS SUBJECT IS DOING IN OUR SYLLABUS.
